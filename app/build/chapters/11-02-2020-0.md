## Incubation period 24 days

So far it was believed that a quarantine period of 14 days would have been enough.
Recent study, looking at 1099 patients, show that the median incubation time is 3 days with a range between 0 and 24 days.
24 days is an outlier and it has been justified as a re-infection case. During the initial incubation of the virus there can be a re-infection that makes the exposure look longer than what it really is. Same happened with Ebola.
