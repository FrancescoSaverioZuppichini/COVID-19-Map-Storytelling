## A Drug for COVID-19

The death toll tops 500.

Testing in the US moves from CDC to local labs. A medication, named Remdesivir, has been tested successfully on coronavirus in vitro. Remdesivir stops the polymerization and reproduction of the virus' RNA.
This medication has been tested for compassionate use on a patient affected by coronavirus in Washington. Within a day the patient got better and the fever disappeared within 3-4 days. This medication has never worked in vivo and trial tests are going to be undertaken in China. Gilead, is the company producing this drug.
Also, another medication, Chloroquine, has been tested and works well.
