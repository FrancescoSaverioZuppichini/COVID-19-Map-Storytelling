## Fake news?

Carl Bergstrom, a professor of biology at the University of Washington, was [interviewd](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/15/806365997/troll-watch-misinformation-around-the-coronavirus?t=1583921178208) to speak about the fake news around the covorona virus. 

He discussed different reasons why lots of misinformations about the coronavirus are spreading around the web.

Some sources, due to political reasons, try to make the China situation as bad as possible to decrease the trust in the goverment. While, others just spread misinformation for profit, using to sell treatmens of various kinds. 

This stream of fake news hurts the people trying to inform themselft on the correct actions to take against the virus. The professor, encourages to gather information only from the trusted medical source, such as WHO.
