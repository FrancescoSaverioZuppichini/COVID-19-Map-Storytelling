## Spillover from Bats

Three years ago a group of researchers collected samples from bats to investigate the SARS outbreak. They found more than four hundred of different species of coronaviruses were found in these animals. However, they did not think the virus could jump to humans since spillovers were rare. They just discovered that SARS-CoV-2 matches with one of the 400 different species of coronavirus. So, possible the virus could have jumped from bats to animals and then to humans.
