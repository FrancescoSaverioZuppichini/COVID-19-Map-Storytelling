## A Drug for COVID-19

Almost 500 people are death.

Testing in the US moves from CDC to local labs. A medication, named Remdesivir, has been tested successfully on coronavirus in vitro. Remdesivir stops the polzmeriyation and reproduction of the virus RNA.
This medication has been tested for compassionate use on a patient affected by
coronavirus in Whashington. Within a day the patient got better and the fever disappeared within 3-4 days. This medication has never worked in vivo and trial tests are going to be undertaken in China. The company that produces this drug is called Gilead.
Also another medication, Chloroquine, has been tested and works really well.
