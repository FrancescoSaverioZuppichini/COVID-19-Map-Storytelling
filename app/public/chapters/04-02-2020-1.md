3 new cases in California, first patient in Washington and 2 deaths reported outside China. 

In China they were able to pick up the RNA of the coronavirus from a door handle, proving how infective the virus is.

There is [good evidence](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2005.02610.x) that the virus can also be spread by only flushing the toilet in public restrooms.
