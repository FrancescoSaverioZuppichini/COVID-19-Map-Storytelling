## Information leakage

There has been an unsupported leakage of information from China.
Apparently China covered up the real data that indicate a total amount of deaths of 24589 people and 154023 confirmed cases of infection. This amounts to a $16\%$ fatality rate that is not consistent with what is happening outside China. Therefore this information might not be reliable.
