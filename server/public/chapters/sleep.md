## Sleep against virus

Immunity is the key to survive viral infection. If you get the coronavirus you want your immune system to work perfectly. What we can do is SLEEP, sleep is the answer!

We would like to highlight three studies that stress the importance of sleep to fight viral infections.

The first paper show that deprivation of sleep translates into decrease immunity.
Adults should sleep between 7 and 9 hours a night but only 60% are actually getting this amount of sleep.

In another work the authors studied 2 groups of 11 (A) and 14 (B) people each. In group A, people were only allowed to sleep 4 hours per night for 6 days, followed by 12 hours per night for other 6 days. On the other hand, people in group B were allowed to sleep 8 hours for 12 days. In the 4th night, both groups were administered flu shots. The results show that the sleep deprivation in group A, even though they recovered sleep in the last 6 nights, reduce the body’s abilities to fight off the flu.

The last study cover 153 patients. A seasonal cold has been induced in the people under study and it was monitored for 5 days. The authors analyzed the results based on patients’ sleeping habits.
           First, they looked at sleep duration. People who sleep < 7 hours were 3 times more likely to get a cold compared to the ones that slept more than 8 hours.
Second, they considered sleep efficiency. Those who were asleep less than 92% of the time were 5.5 more likely to get a cold. So it’s not only important how long one is sleeping but also how well.
