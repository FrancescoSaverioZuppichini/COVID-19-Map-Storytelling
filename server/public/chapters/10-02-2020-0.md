## More deadly than SARS

Deaths from COVID-19 have surpassed SARS virus.

A study was performed on 138 patients that were infected in the month of January. Symptoms: fever in 98.6% of the cases, fatigue in 70%, cough in 59%. When looking at CT scans 100% of the patients present ground glass opacity (GGO).
Treatments: standard flu medications, antibiotics and steroids.
41% of these patients came to the hospital without the COVID-19 virus but they developed it once there.
